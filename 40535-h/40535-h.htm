<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_ix" title="ix"> </a>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Three</span> main questions may be asked
with reference to immigration&mdash;</p>

<p><i>First:</i> A question of principle: Have we
any right to regulate immigration?</p>

<p><i>Second:</i> A question of fact: What is the
nature of our present immigration?</p>

<p><i>Third:</i> A question of interpretation: Is
immigration good for us?</p>

<p>The difficulty with the first question is to
get its existence recognized. In a matter
that has such obvious material aspects as the
immigration problem the abstract principles
involved are likely to be overlooked. But as
there can be no sound conclusions without a
foundation in underlying principles, this discussion
must begin by seeking an answer to
the ethical question involved.</p>

<p>The second question is not easy to answer
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_x" title="x"> </a>
for the reason that men are always poor
judges of their contemporaries, especially of
those whose interests appear to clash with
their own. We suffer here, too, from a bewildering
multiplicity of testimony. Every
sort of expert whose specialty in any way
touches the immigrant has diagnosed the
subject according to the formulæ of his own
special science&mdash;and our doctors disagree!
One is forced to give up the luxury of a second-hand
opinion on this subject, and to attempt
a little investigation of one’s own,
checking off the dicta of the specialists as
well as an amateur may.</p>

<p>The third question, while not wholly separable
from the second, is nevertheless an inquiry
of another sort. Whether immigration
is good for us depends partly on the intrinsic
nature of the immigrant and partly on our
reactions to his presence. The effects of immigration,
produced by the immigrant in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xi" title="xi"> </a>
partnership with ourselves, some men will approve
and some deplore, according to their
notions of good and bad. That thing is good
for me which leads to my ultimate happiness;
and we do not all delight in the same things.
The third question, therefore, more than
either of the others, each man has to answer
for himself.</p>

<h2 class="small-margin-above">I<br/>
<small>THE LAW OF THE FATHERS</small></h2>

<blockquote>
<p>And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be
in thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy
children.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. And thou shalt write them upon the posts of
thy house, and on thy gates.</p>

<p class="right small-caps">Deut. vi, 6, 7, 9.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">If</span> I ask an American what is the fundamental
American law, and he does not
answer me promptly, “That which is contained
in the Declaration of Independence,”
I put him down for a poor citizen. He who is
ignorant of the law is likely to disobey it.
And there cannot be two minds about the
position of the Declaration among our documents
of state. What the Mosaic Law is to
the Jews, the Declaration is to the American
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
people. It affords us a starting-point in history
and defines our mission among the nations.
Without it, we should not differ greatly
from other nations who have achieved a constitutional
form of government and various
democratic institutions. What marks us out
from other advanced nations is the origin
of our liberties in one supreme act of political
innovation, prompted by a conscious
sense of the dignity of manhood. In other
countries advances have been made by favor
of hereditary rulers and aristocratic parliaments,
each successive reform being grudgingly
handed down to the people from above.
Not so in America. At one bold stroke we
shattered the monarchical tradition, and installed
the people in the seats of government,
substituting the gospel of the sovereignty of
the masses for the superstition of the divine
right of kings.</p>

<p>And even more notable than the boldness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>
of the act was the dignity with which it was
entered upon. In terms befitting a philosophical
discourse, we gave notice to the
world that what we were about to do, we
would do in the name of humanity, in the
conviction that as justice is the end of government
so should manhood be its source.</p>

<p>It is this insistence on the philosophic sanction
of our revolt that gives the sublime
touch to our political performance. Up to the
moment of our declaration of independence,
our struggle with our English rulers did not
differ from other popular struggles against
despotic governments. Again and again we
respectfully petitioned for redress of specific
grievances, as the governed, from time immemorial,
have petitioned their governors.
But one day we abandoned our suit for petty
damages, and instituted a suit for the recovery
of our entire human heritage of freedom;
and by basing our claim on the fundamental
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
principles of the brotherhood of man and the
sovereignty of the masses, we assumed the
championship of the oppressed against their
oppressors, wherever found.</p>

<p>It was thus, by sinking our particular
quarrel with George of England in the universal
quarrel of humanity with injustice,
that we emerged a distinct nation, with a
unique mission in the world. And we revealed
ourselves to the world in the Declaration
of Independence, even as the Israelites
revealed themselves in the Law of Moses.
From the Declaration flows our race consciousness,
our sense of what is and what is
not American. Our laws, our policies, the
successive steps of our progress&mdash;all must
conform to the spirit of the Declaration of
Independence, the source of our national
being.</p>

<p>The American confession of faith, therefore,
is a recital of the doctrines of liberty and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
equality. A faithful American is one who
understands these doctrines and applies them
in his life.</p>

<p>It should be easy to pick out the true
Americans&mdash;the spiritual heirs of the founders
of our Republic&mdash;by this simple test of
loyalty to the principles of the Declaration.
To such a test we are put, both as a nation
and as individuals, every time we are asked
to define our attitude on immigration. Having
set up a government on a declaration
of the rights of man, it should be our first
business to reaffirm that declaration every
time we meet a case involving human rights.
Now every immigrant who emerges from the
steerage presents such a case. For the alien,
whatever ethnic or geographic label he carries,
in a primary classification of the creatures
of the earth, falls in the human family.
The fundamental fact of his humanity established,
we need only rehearse the articles of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
our political faith to know what to do with
the immigrant. It is written in our basic law
that he is entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness. There is nothing left for us
to do but to open wide our gates and set him
on his way to happiness.</p>

<p>That is what we did for a while, when our
simple law was fresh in our minds, and the
habit of applying it instinctive. Then there
arose a fashion of spelling immigration with
a capital initial, which so confused the national
eye that we began to see a <span class="small-caps">Problem</span>
where formerly we had seen a familiar phenomenon
of American life; and as a problem
requires skillful handling, we called an army
of experts in consultation, and the din of
their elaborate discussions has filled our ears
ever since.</p>

<p>The effect on the nation has been disastrous.
In a matter involving our faith as
Americans, we have ceased to consult our
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
fundamental law, and have suffered ourselves
to be guided by the conflicting reports
of commissions and committees, anthropologists,
economists, and statisticians, policy-mongers,
calamity-howlers, and self-announced
prophets. Matters irrelevant to the
interests of liberty have taken the first place
in the discussion; lobbyists, not patriots,
have had the last word. Our American sensibility
has become dulled, so that sometimes
the cries of the oppressed have not reached
our ears unless carried by formal deputations.
In a department of government which
brings us into daily touch with the nations of
the world, we have failed to live up to our
national gospel and have not been aware of
our backsliding.</p>

<p>What have the experts and statisticians
done so to pervert our minds? They have
filled volumes with facts and figures, comparing
the immigrants of to-day with the immigrants
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
of other days, classifying them as to
race, nationality, and culture, tabulating
their occupations, analyzing their savings,
probing their motives, prophesying their ultimate
destiny. But what is there in all this
that bears on the right of free men to choose
their place of residence? Granted that Sicilians
are not Scotchmen, how does that affect
the right of a Sicilian to travel in pursuit of
happiness? Strip the alien down to his anatomy,
you still find a <em>man</em>, a creature made in
the image of God; and concerning such a one
we have definite instructions from the founders
of the Republic. And what purpose was
served by the bloody tide of the Civil War if
it did not wash away the last lingering doubts
as to the brotherhood of men of different
races?</p>

<p>There is no impropriety in gathering together
a mass of scientific and sociological
data concerning the newcomers, as long as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
we understand that the knowledge so gained
is merely the technical answer to a number of
technical questions. Where we have gone
wrong is in applying the testimony of our
experts to the moral side of the question. By
all means register the cephalic index of the
alien,&mdash;the anthropologist will make something
of it at his leisure,&mdash;but do not let it
determine his right to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>I do not ask that we remove all restrictions
and let the flood of immigration sweep in unchecked.
I do ask that such restrictions as
we impose shall accord with the loftiest interpretation
of our duty as Americans. Now our
first duty is to live up to the gospel of liberty,
through the political practices devised by our
forefathers and modified by their successors,
as democratic ideas developed. But political
practices require a territory wherein to operate&mdash;democracy
must have standing-room&mdash;so
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
it becomes our next duty to guard our
frontiers. For that purpose we maintain two
forms of defense: the barbaric devices of
army and navy, to ward off hostile mass invasions;
and the humane devices of the immigration
service, to regulate the influx of
peaceable individuals.</p>

<p>We have plenty of examples to copy in our
military defenses, but when it comes to the
civil branch of our national guard, we dare
not borrow foreign models. What our neighbors
are doing in the matter of regulating
immigration may or may not be right for us.
Other nations may be guided chiefly by economic
considerations, while we are under
spiritual bonds to give first consideration to
the moral principles involved. For this, our
peculiar American problem, we must seek a
characteristically American solution.</p>

<p>What terms of entry may we impose on the
immigrant without infringing on his inalienable
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
rights, as defined in our national charter?
Just such as we would impose on our
own citizens if they proposed to move about
the country in companies numbering thousands,
with their families and portable belongings.
And what would these conditions
be? They would be such as are required by
public safety, public health, public order.
Whatever limits to our personal liberty we
are ourselves willing to endure for the sake
of the public welfare, we have a right to impose
on the stranger from abroad; these,
and no others.</p>

<p>Has, then, the newest arrival the same
rights as the established citizen? According
to the Declaration, yes; the same right to
live, to move, to try his luck. More than
this he does not claim at the gate of entrance;
with less than this we are not authorized to
put him off. We do not question the right of
an individual foreigner to enter our country
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
on any peaceable errand; why, then, question
the rights of a shipload of foreigners?
Lumping a thousand men together under the
title of immigrants does not deprive them of
their humanity and the rights inherent in humanity;
or can it be demonstrated that the
sum of the rights of a million men is less than
the rights of one individual?</p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence, like the
Ten Commandments, must be taken literally
and applied universally. What would
have been the civilizing power of the Mosaic
Code if the Children of Israel had repudiated
it after a few generations? As little virtue is
there in the Declaration of Independence if
we limit its operation to any geographical
sphere or historical period or material situation.
How do we belittle the works of our
Fathers when we talk as though they wrought
for their contemporaries only! It was no
great matter to shake off the rule of an absent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
tyrant, if that is all that the War of the
Revolution did. So much had been done
many times over, long before the first tree
fell under the axe of a New England settler.
Emmaus was fought before Yorktown, and
Thermopylæ before Emmaus. It is only as
we dwell on the words of Jefferson and
Franklin that the deeds of Washington
shine out among the deeds of heroes. In the
chronicles of the Jews, Moses has a far higher
place than the Maccabæan brothers. And
notice that Moses owes his immortality to
the unbroken succession of generations who
were willing to rule their lives by the Law
that fell from his lips. The glory of the Jews
is not that they received the Law, but that
they kept the Law. The glory of the American
people must be that the vision vouchsafed
to their fathers they in their turn hold
up undimmed to the eyes of successive generations.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>To maintain our own independence is only
to hug that vision to our own bosoms. If we
sincerely believe in the elevating power of
liberty, we should hasten to extend the reign
of liberty over all mankind. The disciples
of Jesus did not sit down in Jerusalem and
congratulate each other on having found
the Saviour. They scattered over the world
to spread the tidings far and wide. We
Americans, disciples of the goddess Liberty,
are saved the trouble of carrying our gospel
to the nations, because the nations come
to us.</p>

<p>Right royally have we welcomed them,
and lavishly entertained them at the feast of
freedom, whenever our genuine national impulses
have shaped our immigration policy.
But from time to time the national impulse
has been clogged by selfish fears and foolish
alarms parading under the guise of civic prudence.
Ignoring entirely the <em>rights</em> of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
case, the immigration debate has raged
about questions of expediency, as if convenience
and not justice were our first concern.
At times the debate has been led by
men on whom the responsibilities of American
citizenship sat lightly, who treated
immigration as a question of the division of
spoils.</p>

<p>A little attention to the principles involved
would have convinced us long ago
that an American citizen who preaches
wholesale restriction of immigration is guilty
of political heresy. The Declaration of Independence
accords to <em>all</em> men an equal share
in the inherent rights of humanity. When we
go contrary to that principle, we are not acting
as Americans; for, by definition, an
American is one who lives by the principles
of the Declaration. And we surely violate
the Declaration when we attempt to exclude
aliens on account of race, nationality, or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
economic status. “All men” means yellow
men as well as white men, men from the
South of Europe as well as men from the
North of Europe, men who hold kingdoms in
pawn, and men who owe for their dinner. We
shall have to recall officially the Declaration
of Independence before we can lawfully
limit the application of its principles to this
or that group of men.</p>

<p>Americans of refined civic conscience have
always accepted our national gospel in its
literal sense. “What becomes of the rights
of the excluded?” demanded the younger
Garrison, in a noble scolding administered
to the restrictionists in 1896.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If a nation has a right to keep out aliens, tell
us how many people constitute a nation, and
what geographical area they have a right to
claim. In the United States, where a thousand
millions can live in peace and plenty under
just conditions, who gives to seventy millions
the right to monopolize the territory? How
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>few can justly own the earth, and deprive those
who are landless of the right to life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness? And what becomes
of the rights of the excluded?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we took our mission seriously,&mdash;as seriously,
say, as the Jews take theirs,&mdash;we
should live with a copy of our law at our side,
and oblige every man who opened his mouth
to teach us, to square his doctrine with the
gospel of liberty; and him should we follow
to the end who spoke to us in the name
of our duties, rather than in the name of our
privileges.</p>

<p>The sins we have been guilty of in our conduct
of the immigration debate have had
their roots in a misconception of our own
position in the land. We have argued the
matter as though we owned the land, and
were, therefore, at liberty to receive or reject
the unbidden guests who came to us by thousands.
Let any man who lays claim to any
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>
portion of the territory of the United States
produce his title deed. Are not most of us
squatters here, and squatters of recent date
at that? The rights of a squatter are limited
to the plot he actually occupies and cultivates.
The portion of the United States territory
that is covered by squatters’ claims is
only a fraction, albeit a respectable fraction,
of the land we govern. In the name of what
moral law do we wield a watchman’s club
over the vast regions that are still waiting to
be staked out? The number of American
citizens who can boast of ancestral acres is
not sufficient to swing a presidential election.
For that matter, those whose claims are
founded on ancestral tenure should be the
very ones to dread an examination of titles.
For it would be shown that these few got
their lands by stepping into dead men’s
shoes, while the majority wrenched their
estates from the wilderness by the labor of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>
their own hands. In the face of the sturdy
American preference for an aristocracy of
brain and brawn, the wisest thing the man
with a pedigree can do is to scrape the lichens
off his family tree. Think of having it shown
that he owes the ancestral farmhouse to the
deathbed favoritism of some grouchy uncle!
Or, worse still, think of tracing the family
title to some canny deal with a band of
unsophisticated Indians!</p>

<p>No, it will not do to lay claim to the land
on the ground of priority of occupation, as
long as there is a red man left on the Indian
reservations. If it comes to calling names,
usurper is an uglier name than alien. And a
squatter is a tenant who doesn’t pay any
rent, while an immigrant who occupies a
tenement in the slums pays his rent regularly
or gets out.</p>

<p>We may soothe our pride with the reflection
that our title to the land does not depend
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
on the moral validity of individual
claims, but on the collective right of the
nation to control the land we govern. We
came into our land as other nations came into
theirs: we took it as a prize of war. Until
humanity has devised a less brutal method
of political acquisition, we must pass our
national claim as entirely sound. We own
the land because we were strong enough to
take it from England. But the moment we
hark back to the War of the Revolution, our
sense of possession is profoundly modified.
We did not quarrel with the English about
the possession of the colonies, but about their
treatment of the colonists. It was not a land-grab
that was plotted in Independence Hall
in 1776, but a pattern of human freedom.
We entered upon the war in pursuit of ideals,
not in pursuit of homesteads. We had to
take the homesteads, too, because, as we
have already noted, a political ideal has to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>
have territory wherein to operate. But we
must never forget that the shining prize of
that war was an immaterial thing,&mdash;the triumph
of an idea. Not the Treaty of Paris,
but the Declaration of Independence, converted
the thirteen colonies into a nation.</p>

<p>Having taken half a continent in the name
of humanity, shall we hold it in the name of a
few millions? Not as jealous lords of a rich
domain, but as priests of a noble cult shall
we best acquit ourselves of the task our
Fathers set us. And it is the duty of a priest
to minister to as many souls as he can reach.
The most revered of our living teachers has
passed this word:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the mission of the United States to spread
freedom throughout the world by teaching as
many men and women as possible in freedom’s
largest home how to use freedom rightly through
practice in liberty under law.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">And our ardor shall not be dampened by the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>
reflection that perhaps the Fathers builded
better than they knew. “Do you really think
they looked so far ahead?” it is often asked.
“Did the founders of the Republic foresee
the time when foreign hordes would alight
on our shores, demanding a share in this
goodly land that was ransomed with the
blood of heroes?” Fearful questions, these,
to make us pause in the work of redeeming
mankind! If our Fathers did not foresee the
whole future, shall we therefore be blind to
the light of our own day? If they had left us
a mere sketch of their idea, could we do less
than fill in the outlines? Since they left us
not a sketch, but a finished model, the least
we can do is to go on copying it on an ever
larger scale. Neither shall we falter because
the execution of the enlarged copy entails
much labor on us and on our children. When
Moses told the Egyptian exiles that they
should have no god but the One God, he may
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
not have guessed that their children would be
brought to the stake for refusing other gods;
and yet nineteen centuries of Jewish martyrdom
go to show that the followers of Moses
did not make his lack of foresight an excuse
for abandoning his Law.</p>

<p>Let the children be brought up to know
that we are a people with a mission, and that
mission, in the words of Dr. Eliot, to teach
the uses of freedom to as many men as possible
“in freedom’s largest home.” Let it be
taught in the public schools that the most
precious piece of real estate in the whole
United States is that which supports the
pedestal of the Statue of Liberty; that we
need not greatly care how the three million
square miles remaining is divided among the
people of the earth, as long as we retain that
little island. Let it further be repeated in the
schools that the Liberty at our gates is the
handiwork of a Frenchman; that the mountain-weight
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
of copper in her sides and the
granite mass beneath her feet were bought
with the pennies of the poor; that the verses
graven on a tablet within the base are the
inspiration of a poetess descended from
Portuguese Jews; and all these things shall be
interpreted to mean that the love of liberty
unites all races and all classes of men into one
close brotherhood, and that we Americans,
therefore, who have the utmost of liberty
that has yet been attained, owe the alien a
brother’s share.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>To this position we are brought by a construction
of the Declaration of Independence
which makes of it the law of the land,
binding on American citizens individually
and collectively, and in all circumstances
whatever. Out of this position there is one
avenue of escape, and only one. We may
refuse to read in the Declaration a sincere
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
expression of the faith of 1776, and construe
it instead as a bombastic political manifesto,
advanced by the leaders of the rebellion
as an excuse for a gigantic land-grab.</p>

<p>Let the descendants of the Puritans take
their choice of these two interpretations.
For my part, I have chosen. I have chosen
to read the story of ’76 as a chapter in sacred
history; to set Thomas Jefferson in a class
with Moses, and Washington with Joshua;
to regard the American nation as the custodian
of a sacred trust, and American citizenship
as a holy order, with laws and duties
derived from the Declaration.</p>

<p>For very pride in my country I must
choose thus, for the alternate view takes the
meaning out of American history, reduces the
War of Independence to a war of plunder,
and the Colonial heroes to a band of pious
hypocrites. What, indeed, shall we teach
our children to be proud of if we reject the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
higher interpretation of the deeds of the
Fathers? The American Revolution as a
campaign of conquest is not unique in history;
on the contrary, it has been more than
once surpassed, both in respect to the prowess
of the conquerors and to the magnificence
of the prize. Outside the physical realm,
where our inventions and discoveries and the
material development of a continent belong,
this country has contributed nothing of moment
to the world’s progress, unless it is that
political adaptation of the Golden Rule
which is indicated in the Declaration and
elaborated in the Constitution. In the arts
and sciences we sit, for the most part, at the
feet of foreign masters; in jurisprudence we
have borrowed from the Romans, and the
elements of liberal government we have from
our next of kin, the English. The notion of
the dignity of man, which is the foundation
of the gospel of democracy, is derived from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
Hebrew sources, as the Psalm-singing founders
of New England would be the first to
acknowledge. It was not entirely due to accident
nor to the exigencies of pioneer life that
the meeting-house and the town hall were
one in the New England settlements. The
influence of the Bible is plainly stamped on
the works of the Puritans. What, then, shall
we claim as the great American achievement,
our peculiar treasure in the midst of so much
borrowed glory? A magnificent espousal of
humanity&mdash;that or nothing can we call our
own.</p>

<p>Seeing that they brought nothing into the
world that was all their own, our glorious
dead are not glorious unless we make them
so, by imputing to them the noblest motives
that their case will permit, and rating their
works at not less than face value. Pride demands
it, and, fortunately for our country’s
honor, justice supports the claims of pride.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>
Neither the cynics nor the enthusiasts shall
have the last word in the matter. In the
writings of their contemporaries, in the
casual sayings of their intimates, in the critical
comments of those who came next after
them, we find convincing evidence that in the
minds of the leaders of ’76 the most advanced
political thought of the age crystallized into
a mighty conviction&mdash;the conviction of
the inherent nobility of humankind, which
makes it treason for any man to enslave his
neighbor.</p>

<p>That is the thought that was sent out into
the world on July 4, 1776, and because that
thought has shaped our history, we call it
the basic law of our land, and the Declaration
of Independence our final authority. If
under that authority the immigrant appears
to have rights in our land parallel to our own
rights, we shall not lightly deny his claims,
lest we forfeit our only title to national glory.</p>

<small>JUDGES IN THE GATE</small></h2>

<blockquote><p>Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates

<p class="right small-caps">Deut. xvi, 18.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is nothing so potent in a public
debate as the picturesque catchwords
in which leaders of thought sum up their
convictions. Logic makes fewer converts in a
year than a taking phrase makes in a week.
For catchwords are the popular substitute
for logic, and the man in the street is reduced
to silence by a good round phrase of
the kind that sticks.</p>

<p>Two classes of citizens are especially prone
to fall under the tyranny of phrases: those
whose horizon, through no fault of their own,
is limited by the rim of an empty dinner-pail;
and those whose view of the universe is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>
obstructed by the kitchen-middens of too
many dinners. There is no clear thinking on
an empty stomach, and equally muddled are
the thoughts of the over-full. When I hear
of a public measure that is largely supported
by these two classes of citizens, I know at
once that the measure appeals to human prejudices
rather than to divine reason.</p>

<p>Thus I became suspicious of the restrictionist
movement when I realized that it was
in greatest favor among the thoughtless poor
and the thoughtless rich. I am well aware that
the high-priests of the cult include some of the
most conscientious thinkers that ever helped
to make history, and their earnestness is attested
by a considerable body of doctrine, in
support of which they quote statistics and
special studies and scientific investigations.
But I notice that the rank and file of restrictionists
do not know as much as the titles of
these documents. They have not followed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
the argument at all; they have only caught
the catchwords of restrictionism. And these
catchwords are the sort that appeal to the
mean spots in human nature,&mdash;the distrust
of the stranger, the jealousy of possession, the
cowardice of the stomach. Nothing else is
expressed by such phrases as “the scum of
Europe,” “the exploitation of America’s
wealth,” or “taking the bread from the
mouth of the American workingman.”</p>

<p>Even the least venomous formula of restrictionism,
“immigration isn’t what it used
to be,” raises such a familiar echo of foolish
human nature that I am bound to challenge
its veracity. Does not every generation cry
that the weather isn’t what it used to be,
children are not what they used to be, society
is not what it used to be? “The good old
times” and “the old immigration” may be
twin illusions of limited human vision.</p>

<p>If it is true that immigration is not what
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
it used to be, the fact will appear from a
detailed comparison of the “old” and the
“new” immigration. But which of the immigrant
stocks of the good old times shall be
taken as a standard? Woman’s wisdom urges
me to go right back to the original pattern,
just as I would do if I went to the shops to
match samples. And the original pattern
was brought to this country in the year 1620.
Surely comparison with the Mayflower stock
is the most searching test of the quality of
our immigration that any one could propose.</p>

<p>The predominant virtue of the Pilgrims
was idealism. The things of the spirit were
more to them than the things of the flesh.
May we say the like of our present immigrants?
Of very many of them, yes; a thousand
times yes. Of the 8,213,000 foreigners
landed between the years 1899 and 1909,
990,000 were of that race which for nineteen
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>
centuries has sacrificed its flesh in the service
of the spirit. It takes a hundred times
as much steadfastness and endurance for a
Russian Jew of to-day to remain a Jew as it
took for an English Protestant in the seventeenth
century to defy the established
Church.</p>

<p>Those who think that with the Spanish
Inquisition Jewish martyrdom came to an
end are asked to remember that the Kishinieff
affair is only eight years behind us, and
that Bielostock has been heard from since
Kishinieff, and Mohileff since Bielostock.
And more terrible than the recurrent <i>pogrom</i>,
which hacks and burns and tortures a
few hundreds now and then, is the continuous
bloodless martyrdom of the six million
Jews in Russia through the operation of the
anti-Semitic laws of that country. Thirty
minutes spent in looking over a summary of
these laws recently compiled by an English
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
historian<a name="FootnoteMarker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="footnote-marker">(1)</a> will convince any reader with a
spark of imagination that every Russian
Jewish immigrant to-day is a fugitive from
religious persecution, even as were the English
immigrants of 1620.</p>

<p>But while nobody questions the idealism
of the Jew in religion, the world has been
very slow to credit him with any degree of
civic devotion. The world did not stop to
think that a man has to have a country before
he can prove himself a good citizen. But happily
in recent times he has been put to the
test of civic opportunity, notably in America;
with the result that he was found to possess
a fair share of the civic virtues, from the generosity
displayed in the town meeting, when
citizens vote away their substance to support
a public cause, to the brute heroism of the
battle-field, where mangled flesh gives proof
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
of valiant spirit.<a name="FootnoteMarker_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="footnote-marker">(2)</a> And what the Jews of West
European stock proved in the American wars
for freedom the Jews of Eastern Europe have
proved more recently, by their forwardness
in the Russian revolution of 1905.</p>

<p>No group of people of all the heterogeneous
mass that constitutes the Russian
nation were half so prominent as the Jews in
that abortive attempt at freedom. Witness
the police records of the revolutionary period,
which show that sixty-five out of every hundred
political offenders were Jews, in districts
where the population was fifteen parts
Jewish and eighty-five parts Gentile. When
I visited my native town in the Pale, several
years after the revolution, it was hard to find,
among the young men and women I talked
with, one in a dozen who had not shared in
the dangers of 1905. If we really want to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
know how heartily the Jews played their
part in the revolution, we need only ask the
Russian Government why the anti-Semitic
laws have been so vengefully enforced since
a certain crimson year within the present
decade. And the whole significance of these
things, in the present study, lies in the fact
that precisely that spirit which prompts to
rebellion in despotic Russia rallies in free
America to the support of existing institutions.</p>

<p>If it was a merit in 1620 to flee from
religious persecution, and in 1776 to fight
against political oppression, then many of
the Russian refugees of to-day are a little
ahead of the Mayflower troop, because they
have in their own lifetime sustained the
double ordeal of fight and flight, with all
their attendant risks and shocks.</p>

<p>To obtain a nice balance between the relative
merits of these two groups of rebels, we
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
remind ourselves that, for sheer adventurousness,
migration to America to-day is not
to be mentioned on the same page with the
magnificent exploit of 1620, and we reflect
that the moral glory of the revolution of 1776
is infinitely greater than that of any subsequent
revolt; because that, too, was a path-finding
adventure, with no compass but
faith, no chart but philosophical invention.
On the other hand, it is plain that the Russian
revolutionists moved against greater
odds than the American colonists had to
face. The Russians had to plot in secret,
assemble in the dark, and strike with bare
fists; all this under the very nose of the Czar,
with the benighted condition of the Russian
masses hanging like a cloud over their enterprise.
The colonists were able to lay the
train of revolution in the most public manner,
they had the local government in their
hands, a considerable militia obedient to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
their own captains, and the advantage of
distance from the enemy’s resources, with a
populace advanced in civic experience promising
support to the leaders.</p>

<p>And what a test of heroism was that which
the harsh nature of the Russian Government
afforded! The American rebels risked their
charters and their property; for some of them
dungeons waited, and for the leaders dangled
a rope, no doubt. But confiscation is not so
bitter as Siberian exile, and a halter is less
painful than the barbed whip of the Cossacks.
The Minutemen at Concord Bridge defied a
bully; the rioters in St. Petersburg challenged
a tiger. And first of all to be thrust into the
cage would be the rebels of Jewish faith, and
nobody knew that better than the Jews
themselves.</p>

<p>The superior zeal and high degree of self-sacrifice
displayed by the Jewish revolutionists
would naturally be explained by the fact
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
that, of all the peoples held in chains by the
Russian Government, the Jews are the ones
who have suffered the cruelest oppression.
But there is proof, proof that will go down
with the stream of history, that the Jewish
participants in the Russian revolution of
1905 were actuated by the highest patriotism,
their peculiar grievances being forgotten
in the grievances of the nation as a whole.
The sinking of the Jewish question in the
national question was an important article of
the revolutionary propaganda among the
Jews; so much so, that when a prominent
Jewish leader attempted to demonstrate, on
philosophical grounds, that that was a false
position to take, he was hotly repudiated,
although up to that time he had stood high
in the councils of the leaders.<a name="FootnoteMarker_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="footnote-marker">(3)</a></p>

<p>If we find such a high degree of civic responsiveness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
in what we have been trained to
think the most unlikely quarter, shall we not
look hopefully in other corners of our world
of immigrants? If the Jewish spirit of freedom
leaps from the grave of Barkochla to the
hovels of the Russian ghetto, half across the
world and half across the civilized era, shall
we not look for similar prodigies from the
more recent graves of Kosciuszko and Garibaldi?
If the hook-nosed tailor can turn hero
on occasion, why not the grinning organ-grinder,
and the surly miner, and the husky
lumber-jack? We experienced a shock of surprise,
a little while ago, when troops of our
Greek immigrants deserted the bootblacking
parlors and fruit-stands and tumbled aboard
anything that happened to sail for the Mediterranean,
in their eagerness&mdash;it’s hard to
bring it out, in connection with a “Dago”
bootblack!&mdash;in their eagerness to strike a
blow for their country in her need.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>But that’s the worst of calling names: it
deceives those who do so. The little bootblacks
would not have fooled us as they did
if we had not recklessly summed up the
Greek character in a contemptuous epithet.
It is quite proper for street urchins to invent
nicknames for everybody&mdash;that is what
street urchins are for; but let us not hand
down the judgment of the gutter where the
judgment of the senate is called for. Between
Leonidas at the pass and little Metro under
the saloon window, fawning for our nickels,
is indeed a dismal gap; and yet Metro, when
occasion demanded, reached out his grimy
hand and touched the tunic of the Spartan
hero.</p>

<p>From these unexpected exploits of the
craven Jew and the degenerate Greek, it
would seem as if the different elements of the
despised “new” immigration only await a
spectacular opportunity to prove themselves
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
equal to the “old” in civic valor. But if contemporary
history fails to provide a war or
revolution for each of our foreign nationalities,
we are still not without the means of
gauging the idealistic capacity of the aliens.
Next after liberty, the Puritans loved education;
and to-day, if you examine the registers
of the schools and colleges they founded, you
will find the names of recent immigrants
thickly sprinkled from A to Z, and topping
the honor ranks nine times out of ten. All
readers of newspapers know the bare facts,&mdash;each
commencement season, the prize-winners
are announced in a string of unpronounceable
foreign names; and every
school-teacher in the immigrant section of
the larger cities has a collection of picturesque
anecdotes to contribute: of heroic
sacrifices for the sake of a little reading and
writing; of young girls stitching away their
youth to keep a brother in college; of whole
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
families cheerfully starving together to save
one gifted child from the factory.</p>

<p>Go from the public school to the public
library, from the library to the social settlement,
and you will carry away the same
story in a hundred different forms. The good
people behind the desks in these public
places are fond of repeating that they can
hardly keep up with the intellectual demands
of their immigrant neighbors. In the experience
of the librarians it is the veriest commonplace
that the classics have the greatest
circulation in the immigrant quarters of the
city; and the most touching proof of reverence
for learning often comes from the illiterate
among the aliens. On the East Side
of New York, “Teacher” is a being adored.
Said a bedraggled Jewish mother to her little
boy who had affronted his teacher, “Don’t
you know that teachers is holy?” Perhaps
these are the things the teachers have in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>
mind when they speak with a tremor of
the immense reward of work in the public
schools.</p>

<p>That way of speaking is the fashion among
workers of all sorts in the educational institutions
where foreigners attend in numbers.
Get a group of settlement people swapping
anecdotes about their immigrant neighbors,
and there is apt to develop an epidemic
of moist eyes. Out of the fullness of their
knowledge these social missionaries pay
the tribute of respect and affection to the
strangers among whom they toil. For they
know them as we know our brothers and sisters,
from living and working and rejoicing
and sorrowing together.</p>

<p>The testimony of everyday experience is
borne out by the sudden revelations of
catastrophic circumstances, as reported by
a librarian from Dayton, Ohio. In Dayton
they had branch libraries located in different
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
parts of the city, not in separate library
buildings, but in convenient shops or dwelling-houses,
where they were left in the care
of some responsible person in the neighborhood.
After the recent flood,<a name="FootnoteMarker_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="footnote-marker">(4)</a> when the
panic was over and the people began to dig
for their belongings underneath the accumulated
slime and wreckage, the librarian tried
to collect at the central library whatever
was recovered of the scattered collection.
Crumpled, mutilated, slimy with the filth
of the disemboweled city, the books came
back&mdash;all but one collection, which had
been housed in the midst of the Hungarian
quarter. These came back neatly packed,
scraped clean of mud, their leaves smoothed,
dried,&mdash;as presentable as loving care could
make them.</p>

<p>If that was not a manifestation of pure
idealism, then is human conduct void of symbolism,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
and our public squares are cumbered
in vain with monuments erected in commemoration
of human deeds. But we read men’s
souls in their actions, and we know that they
who flock to the schools are the spiritual
kindred of those who founded them; they
who cherish a book are passing along the
torch kindled by him who wrote it. They pay
the highest tribute to an inventor who show
the most eagerness to adopt his invention.
The great New England invention of compulsory
education is more eagerly appropriated
by the majority of our immigrants than
by native Americans of the corresponding
level. That is what the school-teachers say,
and I suppose they know. They also say,&mdash;they
and all public educators in chorus,&mdash;that
while one foreign nationality excels in
the love of letters, another excels in the love
of music, and a third in the love of science;
and all of them together constitute an army
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
whose feet keep time with the noble rhythms
of culture.</p>

<p>Let a New Yorker on Friday night watch
the crowd pushing out of a concert hall after
one of Ysaye’s recitals, and on Saturday
afternoon let him take the subway uptown,
and get out where the crowd gets out, and
buy a ticket for the baseball game. If he can
keep cool enough for a little study, let him
compare the distorted faces in the bleachers
with the shining faces of the crowd of the
night before; and let him say which crowd
responded to the nobler inspiration, and then
let him declare in which group the foreigners
outnumbered the Americans.</p>

<p>The American devotion to sport is no reproach
to the descendants of the Puritans,
since it can be demonstrated from various
angles that the baseball diamond may supplement
the schoolroom and the pulpit in
the training of American citizens. Indeed, it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
is not difficult to accept that interpretation of
the national sport which reduces a good game
of baseball to an epitome of all that is best in
the lives of the best Americans. At the same
time we need to remember that the love of
art is more generally accepted as a mark of
grace than the love of sport. Thus, when we
speak of the glory of old Athens we have in
mind not the Olympian games, noble as they
were, but the poets and sculptors and philosophers
who uttered her thoughts. The
original of the Discobolus must have been a
winner,&mdash;I can imagine Athenian mothers
lifting up their beautiful bare babies to see
the hero over the heads of the throng,&mdash;but
who can tell me his name to-day? Meanwhile
the name of Myron has been guarded
as a talisman of civilization.</p>

<p>We shall not look in the sporting columns,
then, for the names of contemporary Americans
who are likely to secure us a place of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
honor on the scrolls of history. We look
under the current book reviews, in theatre
programmes, in the announcements of art
galleries. As a by-product of such a search
we announce the discovery that the prizefighters
seem to be near cousins of certain
Americans of turbulent notoriety in politics,
themselves derived from one of the approved
immigrant stocks of the “old” dispensation;
while the singer and painter and writer folk
very often hail from those parts of Europe at
present labeled “undesirable” as a source of
immigration. Nay, is it not a good joke on
the restrictionists that an American singer
who aspires to be a prima donna must trick
herself out with a name borrowed from the
steerage lists of recent arrivals at Ellis
Island?</p>

<p>If it is the scum of Europe that we are
getting in our present immigration, it seems
to be a scum rich in pearls. Pearl-fishing, of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
course, is accompanied by labor and danger
and expense, but it is reckoned a paying
industry, or practical men would not invest
their capital in it. The brunt of the business
falls on the divers, however. Have we divers
willing to go down into our human sea and
risk an encounter with sharks and grope in
the ooze at the bottom? We have our school
teachers and librarians and social missionaries,
whose zest for their work should shame
us out of counting the cost of our human
fishery. As to the accumulations of empty
shells, we are told that in the pearl fisheries
of South America about one oyster in a
thousand yields a pearl; and yet the industry
goes on.</p>

<p>The lesson of the oyster bank goes further
still. We know that the nine hundred and
ninety-nine empty shells have a lining, at
least, of mother-of-pearl. We are thus encouraged
to look for the generic opalescence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>
of humanity in the undistinguished mass of
our immigrants. What do the aliens show of
the specific traits of manhood that go to the
making of good citizens? Immersed in the
tide of American life, do their spiritual secretions
give off that fine lustre of manhood that
distinguished the noble Pilgrims of the first
immigration? The genius of the few is obvious;
the group virtue of the mass on exalted
occasions, such as popular uprisings, has been
sufficiently demonstrated. What we want to
know now is whether the ordinary immigrant
under ordinary circumstances comes anywhere
near the type we have taken as a model.</p>

<p>There can be no effective comparison between
the makers of history of a most romantic
epoch and the venders of bananas on
our own thrice-commonplace streets. But
the Pilgrims were not always engaged in
signing momentous compacts or in effecting
a historic landing. In a secondary capacity
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
they were immigrants&mdash;strangers come to
establish themselves in a strange land&mdash;and
as such they may profitably be used as a
model by which to measure other immigrants.</p>

<p>The historic merit of their enterprise aside,
the virtue of the Pilgrim Fathers was that
they came not to despoil, but to build; that
they resolutely turned their backs on conditions
of life that galled them, and set out to
make their own conditions in a strange and
untried world, at great hazard to life and
limb and fortune; that they asked no favors
of God, but paid in advance for His miracles,
by hewing and digging and ploughing and
fighting against odds; that they respected
humankind, believed in themselves, and
pushed the business of the moment as if the
universe hung on the result.</p>

<p>The average immigrant of to-day, like the
immigrant of 1620, comes to build&mdash;to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
build a civilized home under a civilized government,
which diminishes the amount of
barbarity in the world. He, too, like that
earlier newcomer, has rebelled against the
conditions of his life, and adventured halfway
across the world in search of more acceptable
conditions, facing exile and uncertainty
and the terrors of the untried. He
also pays as he goes along, and in very much
the same coin as did the Pilgrims; awaiting
God’s miracle of human happiness in the
grisly darkness of the mine, in the fierce glare
of the prairie ranch, in the shrivelling heat of
coke-ovens, beside roaring cotton-gins, beside
blinding silk-looms, in stifling tailor-shops, in
nerve-racking engine-rooms,&mdash;in all those
places where the assurance and pride of the
State come to rest upon the courage and patience
of the individual citizen.</p>

<p>There is enough of peril left in the adventure
of emigration to mark him who undertakes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
it as a man of some daring and resource.
Has civilization smoothed the sea, or
have not steamships been known to founder
as well as sailing vessels? Does not the modern
immigrant also venture among strangers,
who know not his ways nor speak his tongue
nor worship his God? If his landing is not
threatened by savages in ambush, he has to
run the gauntlet of exacting laws that serve
not his immediate interests. The early New
England farmer used to carry his rifle with
him in the fields, to be ready for prowling
Indians, and the gutter-merchant of New
York to-day is obliged to carry about the
whole armory of his wits, to avert the tomahawk
of competition. No less cruel than
Indian chiefs to their white captives is the
greedy industrial boss to the laborers whom
poverty puts at his mercy; and how could
you better match the wolves and foxes that
prowled about the forest clearings of our
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_59" title="59"> </a>
ancestors than by the pack of sharpers and
misinformers who infest the immigrant quarters
of our cities?</p>

<p>Measured by the exertions necessary to
overcome them, the difficulties that beset the
modern immigrant are no less formidable
than those which the Pilgrims had to face.
There has never been a time when it was
more difficult to get something for nothing
than it is to-day, but the unromantic setting
of modern enterprises leads us to underestimate
the moral qualities that make success
possible to-day. Undoubtedly the pioneer
with an axe over his shoulder is a more picturesque
figure than the clerk with a pencil
behind his ear, but we who have stood up
against the shocks of modern life should
know better than to confuse the picturesque
with the heroic. Do we not know that it
takes a <em>man</em> to beat circumstances, to-day as
in the days of the pioneers? And manliness is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
always the same mixture of courage, self-reliance,
perseverance, and faith.</p>

<p>Inventions have multiplied since the days
of the Pilgrims, but which of our mechanical
devices takes the place of the old-fashioned
quality of determination where obstacles are
to be overcome? The New England wilderness
retreated not before the axe, but before
the diligence of the men who wielded the axe;
and diligence it is which to-day transmutes
the city’s refuse into a loaf for the ragpicker’s
children. Resourcefulness&mdash;the ability to
adjust the means to the end&mdash;enters equally
in the subtle enterprises of the business man
and in the hardy exploits of the settler; and
it takes as much patience to wait for returns
on a petty investment of capital as it does to
watch the sprouting of an acre of corn.</p>

<p>Hardiness and muscle and physical courage
were the seventeenth-century manifestations
of the same moral qualities which to-day
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>
are expressed as intensity and nerve and
commercial daring. Our country being in
part cultivated, in part savage, we need citizens
with the endowment of the twentieth
century, and citizens with the pioneer endowment.
The “new” immigration, however interpreted,
consists in the main of these two
types. Whether we get these elements in the
proportion best suited to our needs is another
question, to be answered in its place. At this
point it is only necessary to admit that the
immigrant possesses an abundance of the
homely virtues of the useful citizen in times
of peace.</p>

<p>We arrived at this conclusion by a theoretical
analysis of the qualities that carry a man
through life to-day; and that was fair reasoning,
since the great majority of aliens are
known to make good, if not in the first generation,
then in the second or the third. Any
sociologist, any settlement worker, any census
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
clerk will tell you that the history of the
average immigrant family of the “new”
period is represented by an ascending curve.
The descending curves are furnished by degenerate
families of what was once prime
American stock. I want no better proof of
these facts than I find in the respective vocabularies
of the missionary in the slums of
New York and the missionary in the New
England hills. At the settlement on Eldridge
Street they talk about hastening the process
of Americanization of the immigrant; the
country minister in the Berkshires talks
about the rehabilitation of the Yankee
farmer. That is, the one assists at an upward
process, the other seeks to reverse a downward
process.</p>

<p>Right here, in these opposite tendencies of
the poor of the foreign quarters and the poor
of the Yankee fastnesses, I read the most
convincing proof that what we get in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>
steerage is not the refuse, but the sinew and
bone of all the nations. If rural New England
to-day shows signs of degeneracy, it is
because much of her sinew and bone departed
from her long ago. Some of the best blood of
New England answered to the call of “Westward
ho!” when the empty lands beyond the
Alleghanies gaped for population, while on
the spent farms of the Puritan settlements
too many sons awaited the division of the
father’s property. Of those who were left
behind, many, of course, were detained by
habit and sentiment, love of the old home
being stronger in them than the lure of adventure.
Of the aristocracy of New England
that portion stayed at home which was fortified
by wealth, and so did not feel the economic
pressure of increased population; of
the proletariat remained, on the whole, the
less robust, the less venturesome, the men
and women of conservative imagination.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>It was bound to be so, because, wherever
the population is set in motion by internal
pressure, the emigrant train is composed of
the stoutest, the most resourceful of those
who are not held back by the roots of wealth
or sentiment. Voluntary emigration always
calls for the highest combination of the physical
and moral virtues. The law of analogy,
therefore, might suffice to teach us that with
every shipload of immigrants we get a fresh
infusion of pioneer blood. But theory is a
tight-rope on which every monkey of a logician
can balance himself. We practical
Americans of the twentieth century like to
feel the broad platform of tested facts beneath
our feet.</p>

<div class="image-center illustration">
<img src="images/rough-work.jpg" width="466" height="600" alt="" id="rough-work"/>
<div class="caption">ROUGH WORK AND LOW WAGES FOR THE IMMIGRANT</div>
</div>

<p>The fact about the modern immigrant is
that he is everywhere continuing the work
begun by our pioneer ancestors. So much we
may learn from a bare recital of the occupations
of aliens. They supply most of the animal
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
strength and primitive patience that are
at the bottom of our civilization. In California
they gather the harvest, in Arizona
they dig irrigation ditches, in Oregon they
fell forests, in West Virginia they tunnel coal,
in Massachusetts they plant the tedious
crops suitable to an exhausted soil. In the
cities they build subways and skyscrapers
and railroad terminals that are the wonder of
the world. Wherever rough work and low
wages go together, we have a job for the
immigrant.</p>

<p>The prouder we grow, the more we lean on
the immigrant. The Wall Street magnate
would be about as effective as a puppet were
it not for the army of foreigners who execute
his schemes. The magic of stocks and bonds
lies in railroad ties and in quarried stone and
in axle grease applied at the right time. A
Harriman might sit till doomsday gibbering
at the telephone and the stock exchange
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>
would take no notice of him if a band of
nameless “Dagos” a thousand miles away
failed to repair a telegraph pole. New York
City is building an aqueduct that will surpass
the works of the Romans, and the average
New Yorker will know nothing about it until
he reads in the newspapers the mayor’s speech
at the inauguration of the new water supply.</p>

<p>Our brains, our wealth, our ambitions flow
in channels dug by the hands of immigrants.
Alien hands erect our offices, rivet our
bridges, and pile up the proud masonry of
our monuments. Ignoring in this connection
the fact that the engineer as well as the
laborer is often of alien race, we owe to mere
muscle a measure of recognition proportionate
to our need of muscle in our boasted
material progress. An imaginative schoolboy
left to himself must presently catch the resemblance
between the pick-and-shovel men
toiling at our aqueducts and the heroes of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
axe and rifle extolled in his textbooks as the
“sturdy pioneers.” Considered without prejudice,
the chief difference between these two
types is the difference between jean overalls
and fringed buckskins. Contemporaneousness
takes the romance out of everything;
otherwise we might be rubbing elbows with
heroes. Whatever merit there was in hewing
and digging and hauling in the days of the
first settlers still inheres in the same operations
to-day. Yes, and a little extra; for a
stick of dynamite is more dangerous to
handle than a crowbar, and the steam engine
makes more widows in a year than ever
the Indian did with bloody tomahawk and
stealthy arrow.</p>

<p>There is no contention here that every fellow
who successfully passes the entrance
ordeals at Ellis Island is necessarily a hero.
That there are weaklings in the train of the
sturdy throng of foreigners nobody knows
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
better than I. I have witnessed the pitiful
struggles of the unfit, and have seen the failures
drop all around me. But no bold army
ever marched to the field of action without a
fringe of camp-followers on its flanks. The
moral vortex created by the enterprises of
the resolute sucks in a certain number of the
weak-hearted; and this is especially true in
mass movements, where the enthusiasm of
the crowd ekes out the courage of the individual.
If it is not too impious to suggest it,
may there not have been among the passengers
of the Mayflower two or three or half a
dozen who came over because their cousins
did, not because they had any zest for the
adventure?</p>

<p>When we remember that the Pilgrim
Fathers came with their families, we may be
very sure that that was the case, because the
different members of a family are seldom of
the same moral fibre. No doubt the austere
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>
ambitions of the voyagers of the Mayflower
made them stern recruiting masters, but our
knowledge of men in the mass forbids the
assumption that they were all heroes of the
first rank who stepped ashore on Plymouth
Rock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have little sympathy with declaimers about
the Pilgrim Fathers, who look upon them all
as men of grand conceptions and superhuman
foresight. An entire ship’s company of Columbuses
is what the world never saw.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It takes a wizard critic like Lowell to chip
away the crust of historic sentiment and
show us our forefathers in the flesh. Lowell
would agree with me that the Pilgrims were
a picked troop in the sense that there was
an immense preponderance of virtue among
them. And that is exactly what we must say
of our modern immigrants, if we judge them
by the sum total of their effect on our country.</p>

<p>Not a little of the glory of the Pilgrim
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
Fathers rests on their own testimony. Our
opinion of them is greatly enhanced by the
expression we find, in the public and private
documents they have left us, of their ideals,
their aims, their expectations in the New
World. Let us judge our immigrants also out
of their own mouths, as future generations
will be sure to judge them. And in seeking
this testimony let us remember that humanity
in general does not produce one oracle in
a decade. Very few men know their own
hearts, or can give an account of the impulses
that drive them in a particular direction.
We put our ears to the lips of the eloquent
when we want to know what the
world is thinking. And what do we get when
we sift down the sayings of the spokesmen
among the foreign folk? An anthem in praise
of American ideals, a passionate glorification
of the principles of democracy.</p>

<p>Let it be understood that the men and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
women of exceptional intellect, who have
surveyed the situation from philosophical
heights, are not trumpeting forth their own
high dreams alone. If they have won the
ear of the American nation and shamed the
indifferent and silenced the cynical, it is because
they voiced the feeling of the inarticulate
mob that welters in the foreign quarters
of our cities. I am never so clear as to the
basis of my faith in America as when I have
been talking with the ungroomed mothers of
the East Side. A widow down on Division
Street was complaining bitterly of the hardships
of her lot, alone in an alien world with
four children to bring up. In the midst of her
complaints the children came in from school.
“Well,” said the hard-pressed widow, “bread
isn’t easy to get in America, but the children
can go to school, and that’s more than bread.
Rich man, poor man, it’s all the same: the
children can go to school.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>The poor widow had never heard of a document
called the Declaration of Independence,
but evidently she had discovered in American
practice something corresponding to one of
the great American principles,&mdash;the principle
of equality of opportunity,&mdash;and she
valued it more than the necessaries of animal
life. Even so was it valued by the Fathers of
the Republic, when they deliberately incurred
the dangers of a war with mighty England
in defense of that and similar principles.</p>

<div class="image-center illustration">
<img src="images/ungroomed-mother.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="" id="ungroomed-mother"/>
<div class="caption">THE UNGROOMED MOTHER OF THE EAST SIDE</div>
</div>

<p>The widow’s sentiment was finely echoed
by another Russian immigrant, a man who
drives an ice-wagon for a living. His case is
the more impressive from the fact that he
left a position of comparative opulence in the
old country, under the protection of a
wealthy uncle who employed him as steward
of his estates. He had had servants to wait
on him and money enough to buy some of the
privileges of citizenship which the Russian
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>
Government doles out to the favored few.
“But what good was it to me?” he asked.
“My property was not my own if the police
wanted to take it away. I could spend thousands
to push my boy through the Gymnasium,
and he might get a little education as a
favor, and still nothing out of it, if he isn’t
allowed to be anything. Here I work like a
slave, and my wife she works like a slave, too,&mdash;in
the old country she had servants in the
house,&mdash;but what do I care, as long as I
know what I earn I got it for my own? I got
to furnish my house one chair at a time, in
America, but nobody can take it away from
me, the little that I got. And it costs me
nothing to educate my family. Maybe they
can, maybe they can’t go to college, but all
can go through grammar school, and high
school, too, the smart ones. And all go together!
Rich and poor, all are equal, and I
don’t get it as a favor.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>Better a hard bed in the shelter of justice
than a stuffed couch under the black canopy
of despotism. Better a crust of the bread of
the intellect freely given him as his right than
the whole loaf grudgingly handed him as a
favor. What nobler insistence on the rights
of manhood do we find in the writings of the
Puritans?</p>

<p>Volumes might be filled with the broken
sayings of the humblest among the immigrants
which, translated into the sounding
terms of the universal, would give us the
precious documents of American history over
again. Never was the bread of freedom more
keenly relished than it is to-day, by the very
people of whom it is said that they covet
only the golden platter on which it is served
up. We may not say that immigration to our
country has ceased to be a quest of the ideal
as long as the immigrants lay so much stress
on the spiritual accompaniment of economic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>
elevation in America. Nobly built upon the
dreams of the Fathers, the house of our
Republic is nobly tenanted by those who
cherish similar dreams.</p>

<p>But dreams cannot be brought before a
court of inquiry. A diligent immigration
commission with an appropriation to spend
has little time to listen to Joseph. A digest of
its report is expected to yield statistics rather
than rhapsodies. The taxpayers want their
money’s worth of hard facts.</p>

<p>But when the facts are raked together and
boiled down to a summary that the business
man may scan on his way to the office, behold!
we are no wiser than before. For a host
of interpreters jump into the seats vacated
by the extinct commission and harangue us
in learned terms on the merits and demerits
of the immigrant, <em>as they conceive them</em>, after
studying the voluminous report. That is, the
question is still what it was before: a matter
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>
of personal opinion! The man with the vote
realizes that <em>he</em> has to make up <em>his</em> mind what
instructions to send to his representative in
Congress on the subject of immigration. And
where shall he, a plain, practical man, unaccustomed
to interpret dreams or analyze
statistics, find an index of the alien’s worth
that he can read through the spectacles of
common sense?</p>

<p>There is a phrase in the American vocabulary
of approval that sums up our national
ideal of manhood. That phrase is “a self-made
man.” To such we pay the tribute of
our highest admiration, justly regarding our
self-made men as the noblest product of our
democratic institutions. Now let any one
compile a biographical dictionary of our self-made
men, from the romantic age of our history
down to the prosaic year 1914, and see
how the smell of the steerage pervades the
volume! <em>There</em> is a sign that the practical
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>
man finds it easy to interpret. Like fruits
grow from like seeds. Those who can produce
under American conditions the indigenous
type of manhood must be working with the
same elements as the native American who
starts out a yokel and ends up a senator.</p>

<p>Focused under the microscope of theoretical
analysis, or viewed through the spectacles
of common sense, the average immigrant of
to-day still shows the markings of virtue
that have distinguished the best Americans
from the time of the landing at Plymouth to
the opening of the Panama Canal. But popular
judgment is seldom based on a study of
the norm, especially in this age of the newspaper.
The newspaper is devoted to the portrayal
of the abnormal&mdash;the shining example
and the horrible example; and most men
think they have done justice when they have
balanced the one against the other, leaving
out of account entirely the great mass that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
lies between the two extremes. And even of
the two extremes, it is the horrible example
that is more frequently brought to the attention
of the public. Half a dozen Italians
draw knives in a brawl on a given evening,
and the morning newspapers are full of the
story. On the same evening hundreds of
Italians were studying civics in the night
schools, inquiring for classics at the public
library, rehearsing for a historical pageant at
the settlement&mdash;and not a word about them
in the newspapers. One Jewish gangster
makes more “copy” than a hundred Jewish
boys and girls who win honors in college. So
also it is the business of the police to record
the fact that a Greek was arrested for peddling
without a license, while it is nobody’s
business to report that a dozen other Greeks
chipped in their spare change to pay his fine.
The reader of newspapers is convinced that
the foreigners as a whole are a violent,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
vicious, lawless crowd, and the fewer we
have of them the better.</p>

<p>Could the annual reports of libraries and
settlements be circulated as widely as the
newspapers, the American public would not
be guilty of such errors of judgment. But
who reads annual reports? The very name of
them is forbidding! It becomes necessary,
therefore, to explain the newspaper types
that jump to the fore in every discussion of
the immigrant.</p>

<p>First of all we must get a good grip on our
sense of proportion. To speak of the immigrants
as undesirable because a few of them
throw bombs or live by gambling is about
as fair as it would be for the world to call us
Americans a nation of dissolute millionaires
and industrial pirates because a Harry Thaw
drank himself into an insane asylum and a
Rockefeller swept a host of competitors to
ruin.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>But the bomb-thrower and the gambler are
extremely undesirable. Look at the Black
Hand outrages, look at the Rosenthal case!</p>

<p>Aye, I have looked, and I see plainly that
these horrible examples are due to the same
causes as any shining example that could be
named. Each is the product of the qualities
the immigrant brought with him and the
opportunities he found here to exercise them.
The law-abiding, ambitious immigrant who
came here a beggar and worked himself into
the ranks of the princes found his opportunity
in our laws and customs, which enable the
common man to make the most of himself.
The blackmailer’s opportunity was provided
by the operation of corrupt politics, which
removes police commissioners and impeaches
governors for trying to enforce the law. The
Rosenthal case brought forth Lieutenant
Becker, and an investigation of the spread
of the Black Hand terror discovers political
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
bosses behind the scenes.<a name="FootnoteMarker_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="footnote-marker">(5)</a> We have laws
providing for the deportation of alien criminals.
Why are they not always enforced?
When we have found the broom that will
sweep the political vermin from our legislatures,
we shan’t need to look around for a
shovel to keep back the scum of Europe. The
two will go together.</p>

<p>In the whole catalogue of sins with which
the modern immigrant is charged, it is not
easy to find one in which we Americans are
not partners,&mdash;we who can make and unmake
our world by means of the ballot. The
immigrant is blamed for the unsanitary conditions
of the slums, when sanitary experts
cry shame on our methods of municipal
house-cleaning. You might dump the whole
of the East Side into the German capital and
there would be no slums there, because the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
municipal authorities of Berlin know how to
enforce building regulations, how to plant
trees, and how to clean the streets. The
very existence of the slum is laid at the door
of the immigrant, but the truth is that the
slums were here before the immigrants. Most
of the foreigners hate the slums, and all but
the few who have no backbone get out of
them as fast as they rise in the economic
scale. To “move uptown” is the dearest ambition
of the average immigrant family.</p>

<p>If the slums were due to the influx of foreigners,
why should London have slums, and
more hideous slums than New York? No,
the slum is not a by-product of the steerage.
It is a sore on the social body in many civilized
countries, due to internal disorders of
the economic system. A generous dose of
social reformation would do more to effect a
cure than repeated doses of restriction of
immigration.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>A whole group of phenomena due to social
and economic causes have been falsely
traced, in this country, to the quantity and
quality of immigration. Among these are the
labor troubles, such as non-employment,
strikes, riots, etc. England has no such
immigration as the United States, and yet
Englishmen suffer from non-employment,
from riots and bitter strikes. Whom does the
English workingman blame for his misery?
Let the American workingman quarrel with
the same enemy. If wage-cutting is a sin
more justly laid at the door of the immigrant,
a minimum wage law might put a stop to
that.</p>

<p>The immigrant undoubtedly contributes
to the congestion of population in the cities,
but not as a chief cause. Congestion is characteristic
of city life the world over, and the
remedy will be found in improved conditions
of country life. Moreover, the immigrant has
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
shown himself responsive to direction away
from the city when a systematic attempt is
made to help him find his place in the country.
There is the experience of the Industrial
Removal Office of the Baron de Hirsch
Foundation as a hint of what the Government
might accomplish if it took a hand in
the intelligent distribution of immigration.
The records of this organization, dealing with
a group of immigrants supposed to be especially
addicted to city life, kill two immigrant
myths at one stroke. They prove that
it is possible to direct the stream of immigration
in desired channels and that the Jew is
not altogether averse to contact with the
soil; both facts contrary to popular notions.</p>

<p>A good deal of anti-immigration feeling has
been based on the vile conditions observed
in labor camps, by another turn of that logic
which puts the blame on the victims. A labor
camp at its worst is not an argument against
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
immigration, but an indictment of the brutality
of the contractor who cares only to
force a maximum of work out of the workmen,
and cares nothing for their lives; an indictment
also of the Government that allows
such shameful exploitation of the laborers to
go on. That a labor camp does not have to
be a plague spot has been gloriously demonstrated
by Goethals at Panama. What
Goethals did was to emphasize the <em>man</em> in
workingman, with the result that Panama
during the vast operations of digging the
Canal was a healthier, happier, more inspiring
place to live in than many of our proudest
cities; the workmen came away from the
job better men and better citizens; and the
work was better done and with more dispatch
and at less expense than any such
work was ever done by the old-fashioned
method, where the workers are treated not as
men but as tools.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>There may not be another Goethals in the
country, but what a great man devises little
men may copy. The labor camp must never
again be mentioned as a reproach to the immigrant
who suffers degradation in it, or the
world will think that we do not know the
meaning of the medals which we ourselves
have hung on Goethals’s breast.</p>

<p>Immigrants are accused of civic indifference
if they do not become naturalized, but
when we look into the conditions affecting
naturalization we wonder at the numbers
who do become citizens. Facilities for civic
education of the adult are very scant, and
dependent mostly on the fluctuating enthusiasm
of private philanthropies. The administration
of the naturalization laws differs
from State to State and is accompanied by
serious material hindrances; while the community
is so indifferent to the civic progress
of its alien members that it is possible for a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
foreigner to live in this country for <em>sixteen
years</em>, coming in contact with all classes of
Americans, without getting the bare information
that he may become a citizen of the
United States if he wants to. Such a case, as
reported by a charity worker of New Britain,
Connecticut, makes a sensitive American
choke with mortification. If we were
ourselves as patriotic as we expect the immigrant
to be, we would employ Salvation
Army methods to draw the foreigner into the
civic fold. Instead of that, we leave his citizenship
to chance&mdash;or to the most corrupt
political agencies.</p>

<p>I would rather not review the blackest of
all charges against the immigrant, that he
has a baleful effect on municipal politics: I
am so ashamed of the implications. But sensible
citizens will talk and talk about the
immigrant selling his vote, and not know
whom they are accusing. Votes cannot be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
sold unless there is a market for them. Who
creates the market for votes? The ward politician,
behind whom stands the party boss,
alert, and powerful; and behind him&mdash;the
indifferent electorate who allow him to
flourish.</p>

<p>Among immigrants of the “new” order,
the wholesale prostitution of the ballot is
confined to those groups which are largely
subjected to the industrial slavery of mining
and manufacturing communities and construction
camps. These helpless creatures, in
their very act of sinning, bear twofold witness
against us who accuse them. The foreman
who disposes of their solid vote acquires
his power under an economic system which
delivers them up, body and soul, to the man
who pays them wages, and turns it to account
under a political system which makes
the legislature subservient to the stock exchange.
But let it be definitely noted that to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
admit that groups of immigrants under economic
control fall an easy prey to political
corruptionists is very far from proving any
inherent viciousness in the immigrants themselves.</p>

<p>Neither does the immigrant’s civic reputation
depend entirely on negative evidence.
New York City has the largest foreign population
in the United States, and precisely in
that city the politicians have learned that
they cannot count on the foreign vote, because
it is not for sale. A student of New
York politics speaks of the “uncontrollable
and unapproachable vote of the Ghetto.”
Repeated analyses of the election returns of
the Eighth District, which has the largest
foreign population of all, show that “politically
it is one of the most uncertain sections”
in the city. Many generations of campaign
managers have discovered to their sorrow
that the usual party blandishments are
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
wasted on the East Side masses. Hester
Street follows leaders and causes rather than
party emblems. Nowhere is the art of splitting
a ticket better understood. The only
time you can predict the East Side vote is
when there is a sharp alignment of the better
citizens against the boss-ridden. Then you
will find the naturalized citizens in the same
camp with men like Jacob Riis and women
like Lillian Wald. And the experience of
New York is duplicated in Chicago and in
Philadelphia and in every center of immigration.
Ask the reformers.</p>

<p>How often we demand more civic virtue of
the stranger than we ourselves possess! A
little more time spent in weeding our own
garden will relieve us of the necessity of
counting the tin cans in the immigrant’s
back yard.</p>

<p>As to tin cans, the immigrants are not the
only ones who scatter them broadcast. How
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
can we talk about the foreigners defacing
public property, when our own bill-boards
disfigure every open space that God tries to
make beautiful for us? It is true that the
East Side crowds litter the parks with papers
and fruit-skins and peanut shells, but they
would not be able to do so if the park regulations
were persistently enforced. And in the
mean time the East Side children, in their
pageants and dance festivals, make the most
beautiful use of the parks that a poet could
desire.</p>

<p>There exists a society in the United States
the object of which is to protect the natural
beauties and historical landmarks of our
country. Who are the marauders who have
called such a society into being? Who is it
that threatens to demolish the Palisades and
drain off Niagara? Who are the vulgar folk
who scrawl their initials on trees and monuments,
who chip off bits from historic tombstones,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
who profane the holy echoes of the
mountains by calling foolish phrases through
a megaphone? The officers of the Scenic and
Historic Preservation Society are not watching
Ellis Island. On the contrary, it was the
son of an immigrant whose expert testimony,
given before a legislative committee at Albany,
helped the Society to save the Falls of
the Genesee from devastation by a power
company. This same immigrant’s son, on
another occasion, spent two mortal hours
tearing off visiting-cards from a poet’s grave&mdash;cards
bearing the names of American vacationists.</p>

<p>Some of the things we say against the
immigrants sound very strange from American
lips. We speak of the corruption of our
children’s manners through contact with
immigrant children in the public schools,
when all the world is scolding us for our children’s
rude deportment. Finer manners are
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
grown on a tiny farm in Italy than in the
roaring subways of New York; and contrast
our lunch-counter manners with the table-manners
of the Polish ghetto, where bread
must not be touched with unwashed hands,
where a pause for prayer begins and ends
each meal, and on festival occasions parents
and children join in folk-songs between
courses!</p>

<p>If there is a corruption of manners, it may
be that it works in the opposite direction
from what we suppose. At any rate, we ourselves
admit that the children of foreigners,
before they are Americanized, have a greater
respect than our children for the Fifth Commandment.</p>

<p>We say that immigrants nowadays come
only to exploit our country, because some of
them go back after a few years, taking their
savings with them. The real exploiters of our
country’s wealth are not the foreign laborers,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
but the capitalists who pay them wages. The
laborer who returns home with his savings
leaves us an equivalent in the products of
labor; a day’s service rendered for every
day’s wages. The capitalists take away our
forests and water-courses and mineral treasures
and give us watered stock in return.</p>

<p>Of the class of aliens who do not come to
make their homes here, but only to earn a
few hundred dollars to invest in a farm or a
cottage in their native village, a greater number
than we imagine are brought over by
industrial agents in violation of the contract
labor law. Put an end to the stimulation of
immigration, and we shall see very few of the
class who do not come to stay. And even as
it is, not all of those who return to Europe
do so in order to spend their American fortune.
Some go back to recover from ruin encountered
at the hands of American land
swindlers. Some go back to be buried beside
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
their fathers, having lost their health in unsanitary
American factories. And some are
helped aboard on crutches, having lost a
limb in a mine explosion that could have been
prevented. When we watch the procession
of cripples hobbling back to their native villages,
it looks more as if America is exploiting
Europe.</p>

<p>O that the American people would learn
where their enemies lurk! Not the immigrant
is ruining our country, but the venal
politicians who try to make the immigrant
the scapegoat for all the sins of untrammeled
capitalism&mdash;these and their masters.
Find me the agent who obstructs the movement
for the abolition of child labor, and I
will show you who it is that condemns able-bodied
men to eat their hearts out in idleness;
who brutalizes our mothers and tortures
tender babies; who fills the morgues
with the emaciated bodies of young girls, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
the infirmaries with little white cots; who
fastens the shame of illiteracy on our enlightened
land, and causes American boys to grow
up too ignorant to mark a ballot; who sucks
the blood of the nation, fattens on its brains,
and throws its heart to the wolves of the
money market.</p>

<p>The stench of the slums is nothing to the
stench of the child-labor iniquity. If the
foreigners are taking the bread out of the
mouth of the American workingman, it is
by the maimed fingers of their fainting little
ones.</p>

<p>And if we want to know whether the immigrant
parents are the promoters or the
victims of the child labor system, we turn to
the cotton mills, where forty thousand native
American children between seven and sixteen
years of age toil between ten and twelve
hours a day, while the fathers rot in the
degradation of idleness.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>From all this does it follow that we should
let down the bars and dispense with the
guard at Ellis Island? Only in so far as the
policy of restriction is based on the theory
that the present immigration is derived from
the scum of humanity. But the immigrants
may be desirable and immigration undesirable.
We sometimes have to deny ourselves
to the most congenial friends who
knock at our door. At this point, however,
we are not trying to answer the question
whether immigration is good for us. We are
concerned only with the reputation of the
immigrant&mdash;and incidentally with the reputation
of those who have sought to degrade
him in our eyes. If statecraft bids us lock the
gate, and our national code of ethics ratifies
the order, lock it we must, but we need not
call names through the keyhole.</p>

<p>Mount guard in the name of the Republic
if the health of the Republic requires it, but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
let no such order be issued until her statesmen
and philosophers and patriots have consulted
together. Above all, let the voice of
prejudice be stilled, let not self-interest chew
the cud of envy in full sight of the nation, and
let no syllable of willful defamation mar the
oracles of state. For those who are excluded
when our bars are down are exiles from Egypt,
whose feet stumble in the desert of political
and social slavery, whose hearts hunger for
the bread of freedom. The ghost of the Mayflower
pilots every immigrant ship, and Ellis
Island is another name for Plymouth Rock.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> the discussion of the third question,&mdash;whether
immigration is good for us,&mdash;more
honest Americans have gone astray
than in the other two divisions. Let it be said
at the outset that those who have erred have
been about equally distributed between the
ayes and the nays. For the answer to this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
question is neither aye nor nay, but something
that cannot be put into a single syllable.
If we steer our way cautiously between
the opposing ranks, the light of the true answer
will presently shine on us.</p>

<p>The arguments they severally advance in
defense of their respective positions reveal an
appalling number of citizens on each side of
the house who have entirely disregarded the
principles involved. Those who, like the
labor-union lobbyists, point to the empty
dinner-pails of American workingmen as a
reason for keeping out foreign labor, are no
more at fault than the lobbyists of the opposite
side, who offer in support of the open-door
policy statistics showing the need of
rough laborers in various branches of our current
material development. All of them are
wrong in that they would treat our foreign
brothers as pawns on the chessboard of our
selfish needs. Show me a million American
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
workingmen out of work, and I fail to see a
justification for the exclusion of a million men
from other lands who are also looking for a
job. Does the mother of an impoverished
family strangle half her brood in order that
the other half may have enough to eat? No;
she divides the last crust equally among her
starvelings, and the laws of nature do the
rest.</p>

<p>This analogy, of course, is a vessel without
a bottom unless the gospel of the brotherhood
of man is accepted as a premise of our
debate. The only logic it will hold is the logic
of a practical incarnation of the theories we
loudly applaud on occasions of patriotic excitement.
That ought to be acceptable both
to the poor men who like to parade the
streets with the Stars and Stripes at the head
of the column and the <cite>Marseillaise</cite> on their
lips, and to the rich men who subscribe generously
to soldiers’ and sailors’ monument
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
funds, and who ransack ancient chronicles to
establish their connection with the heroes
of the Revolution. Let the paraders and
the ancestor-worshipers unite in a practical
recognition of the rights of their belated
brothers who are seeking to enter the kingdom
of liberty and justice, and they will have
given a living shape to the sentiment they
symbolically honor, each in his own way.</p>

<p>I am not content if the labor leaders retire
from the lobby when all the mills are running
full time and shop foremen are scouring the
streets for “hands.” It is no proof of our sincerity
that we are indifferent in times of
plenty as to who it is that picks up the
crumbs after we have fed. They only are
true Americans who, remembering that this
country was wrested from the English in the
name of the common rights of humanity, resist
the temptation to insure their own soup-kettles
by patrolling the national pastures
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>
and granaries against the hungry from other
lands. Share and share alike is the motto of
brotherhood.</p>

<p>But who will venture to preach such devotion
to principle to the starved and naked
and oppressed? Why, I, even I, who refuse to
believe that the American workingman is
past answering the call of a difficult ideal, no
matter what privations are gnawing at his
vitals. I have read in the history books that
when Lincoln issued his call for volunteers,
they came from mills and factories and little
shops as promptly as from counting-rooms
and college halls. Fathers of large families
that looked to him for bread kissed their
babies and marched off to the war, taking an
elder son or two with them. Were they all
aristocrats whose names are preserved on
four thousand gravestones at Gettysburg?
And who were they who went barefoot in the
snow and starved with Washington in Valley
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
Forge? The common people, most of them,
the toilers for daily bread, they who give all
when they give aught, because they have not
enough to divide.</p>

<p>They only mark themselves as calumniators
of the poor who protest that times and
men have changed since Washington’s and
Lincoln’s day; who think that the breed of
heroes died out with the passing of the
Yankee farmer and the provincial townsman
of the earlier periods. Shall not the testimony
of a daughter of the slums be heard
when the poor are being judged? I was reared
in a tenement district of a New England
metropolis, where the poor of many nations
contended with each other for a scant living;
and the only reason I am no longer of the
slums is because a hundred heroes and heroines
among my neighbors fought for my release.
Not only the members of my family,
but mere acquaintances put their little all at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>
my disposal. Merely that a dreamer among
them might come to the fulfillment of her
dream, they fed and sheltered and nursed me
and cheered me on, again and again facing
the wolves of want for my sake, giving me
the whole cloak if the half did not suffice to
save the spark of life in my puny body.</p>

<p>If my knowledge of the slums counts for
anything, it counts for a positive assurance
that the personal devotion which is daily
manifested in the life of the tenements in
repeated acts of self-denial, from the sharing
of a delicacy with a sick neighbor to the education
of a gifted child by the year-long sacrifices
of the entire family, is a spark from
the smouldering embers of idealism that lie
buried in the ashes of sordid existence, and
await but the fanning of a great purpose to
leap up into a flame of abstract devotion.</p>

<p>Times have changed, indeed, since the days
of Washington. His was a time of beginnings,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
ours is a time ripe for accomplishment. And
yet the seed the Fathers sowed we shall not
reap, unless we consecrate ourselves to our
purpose as they did,&mdash;all of us, the whole
people, no man presuming to insult his neighbor
by exempting him on account of apparent
weakness. The common people in Washington’s
time, and again in Lincoln’s time, stood
up like men, because they were called as men,
not as weaklings who must be coddled and
spared the shock of robust moral enterprise.
Not a full belly but a brimming soul made
heroes out of ploughboys in ’76. The common
man of to-day is capable of a like transformation
if pricked with the electric needle
of a lofty appeal. Those who are teaching the
American workingman to demand the protection
of his job against legitimate alien competition
are trampling out the embers of popular
idealism, instead of fanning it into a blaze
that should transfigure the life of the nation.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>Idealism of the finest, heroism unsurpassed,
are frequently displayed in the familiar
episodes of the class war that is going
on before our eyes, under unionistic leadership.
But it is a narrowing of the vision that
makes a great mass of the people adopt as the
unit of human salvation the class instead of
the nation. The struggle which has for its
object the putting of the rapacious rich in
their place does not constitute a full programme
of national progress. If labor leaders
think they are leading in a holy war, they
should be the last to encourage disrespect of
the principles of righteousness for which they
are fighting. It is inconsistent, to put it
mildly, to lead a demonstration against entrenched
capital on one day, and the next
day to head a delegation in Congress in
favor of entrenched labor. Is there anything
brotherly about a monopolization of
the labor market? Substituting the selfishness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
of the poor for the selfishness of the
rich will bring us no nearer the day of universal
justice.</p>

<p>Though I should not hesitate to insist on a
generous attitude toward the foreigner even
if it imposed on our own people all the hardships
which are alleged to be the result of immigration,
I do not disdain to point out the
fact that, when all is said and done, there is
enough of America to go around for many a
year to come. It is hard to know whether to
take the restrictionists seriously when they
tell us that the country is becoming overcrowded.
The population of the United
States is less than three times that of England,
and England is only a dot on our
map. In Texas alone there is room for the
population of the whole world, with a homestead
of half an acre for every family of
five, and a patch the size of Maryland left
over for a public park. A schoolboy’s geography
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
will supply the figures for this pretty
sum.</p>

<p>The over-supply of labor is another myth
of the restrictionist imagination that vanishes
at one glance around the country, which
shows us crops spoiling for want of harvesters,
and women running to the legislature
for permission to extend their legal working-day
in the fields; such is the scarcity of men.
Said ex-Secretary Nagel, commenting upon
the immigration bill which was so strenuously
pushed by the restrictionists in the
Sixty-third Congress, only to be vetoed by
President Taft:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In my judgment no sufficiently earnest and
intelligent effort has been made to bring our
wants and our supply together, and so far the
same forces that give the chief support to this
provision of the new bill [a literacy test, intended
to check the influx of cheap labor] have
stubbornly resisted any effort looking to an
intelligent distribution of new immigration to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>meet the needs of our vast country. [And] no
such drastic measure [as the literacy test]
should be adopted until we have at least exhausted
the possibilities of a rational distribution
of these new forces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Distribution&mdash;geographical, seasonal, occupational;
that should be our next watch-word,
if we are bent on applying our vast
resources to our needs. It cannot be too often
pointed out that a nation of our political confession
is bound to try every other possible
solution of her problems before resorting to
a measure that encroaches on the rights of
humanity. And so far are we from exhausting
the possibilities of internal reform that
even the most obvious economic errors have
not been corrected. It is not good sense nor
good morals to keep men at work twelve and
thirteen hours a day, seven days in the week,
as they do, for example, in the paper-mills.
It is bad policy to use women in the mills; it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
is heinous to use the children. Every one of
those over-long jobs should be cut in two; the
women should be sent back to the nursery,
and the children put to school, and able-bodied
men set in their places.</p>

<p>If such a programme, consistently carried
out throughout the country, still left considerable
numbers unemployed, there is one
more remedy we might apply. We might
chain to the benches in the city parks, where
involuntary idlers now pass the day, all the
agents and runners who move around Europe
at the expense of steamship companies,
labor contractors, and mill-owners. We must
<em>stop</em> the importation of labor, not talk about
stopping it.</p>

<p>To refrain from soliciting immigration is a
very different thing from imposing an arbitrary
check on voluntary immigration, and
gives very different results. The class of men
who are lured across the ocean by the golden
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
promises of labor agents are not of the same
moral order as those who are spurred to the
great adventure by a desire to share in our
American civilization. When we restrain the
runners, we rid ourselves automatically of the
least desirable element of immigration,&mdash;the
hordes of irresponsible job-hunters without
family who do not ask to be steered into
the current of American life, and whose mission
here is accomplished when they have
saved up a petty fortune with which to dazzle
the eyes of peasant sweethearts at home.
It is this class that contributes, through its
ignorance and aloofness, the bulk of the deplorable
phenomena which are quoted by
restrictionists as arguments against immigration
in general. But we must go after them
by the direct method, applying the force of
the law to the agents who rout them out of
their native villages. When we attempt to
weed out this one element by indirect methods,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
such as the oft-proposed literacy test, we
are guilty of the folly of discharging a cannon
into the midst of the sheepfold with the
object of killing the wolf.</p>

<p>If through such a measure as the literacy
test the desired results could be insured, we
should still be loath to adopt it until every
other possible method had been tried. To hit
at labor competition through a pretended
fear of illiteracy is a tricky policy, and trickery
is incompatible with the moral dignity of
the American nation. Are we bankrupt in
statesmanship that we must pawn the jewel
of national righteousness? It required no
small amount of ingenuity to find a connection
between the immigrant’s ability to earn
a wage and his inability to read. If the resourceful
gentlemen who invented the literacy
test would concentrate their talents on
the problem of stopping the stimulation of
immigration, we should soon hear the last
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
of the over-supply of cheap labor. Where
there’s a will there’s a way, in statecraft as
in other things.</p>

<p>It is not enough for the integrity of our
principles to scrutinize the ethical nature of
proposed legislation. It must be understood
in general that whoever asks for restrictive
measures as a means of improving American
labor conditions must prove beyond a doubt,
first, that the evils complained of are not the
result of our own sins, and next, that the foreign
laborer on coming to America has not
exchanged worse conditions for better. The
gospel of brotherhood will not let us define
our own good in terms of indifference to the
good of others.</p>

<p>Preaching selfishness in the name of the
American workingman is an insidious way of
shutting him out from participation in the
national mission. If it is good for the nation
to live up to its highest traditions, it cannot
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
be bad for any part of the nation to contribute
its share toward the furtherance of
the common ideal. For we are not a nation
of high and low, where the aristocracy acts
and the populace applauds. If America is
going to do anything in the world, every man
and woman among us will have a share in it.</p>

<p>Objection to the influx of foreign labor is
sometimes based on a theory the very opposite
of the scarcity of work. Some say that
there is altogether too much work being
done in this country&mdash;that we are developing
our natural resources and multiplying
industries at a rate too rapid for wholesome
growth; and to check this feverish activity it
is proposed to cut off the supply of labor
which makes it possible.</p>

<p>I doubt, in the first place, if it is reasonable
to expect a young nation with half a continent
to explore to restrain its activity, as
long as there are herculean tasks in sight, any
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
more than we would expect a boy to walk off
the diamond in the middle of the game. Or if
it is thought best to slacken the speed of material
progress, the brakes should be applied
at Wall Street, not at Ellis Island. The foreign
laborer is merely the tool in the hands of
the promoter, indispensable to, but not responsible
for, his activities. The workmen
come in <em>after</em> the promoter has launched his
scheme. At least, I have never heard of a
development company or industrial corporation
organized for the purpose of providing
jobs for a shipload of immigrants. That
species of philanthropy our benevolent millionaires
have not hit on as yet.</p>

<p>It is because the brutal method is the easiest
that we are advised to confiscate the tools
of industry in order to check the rate of material
development. The more dignified way
would be to restrain the captains of industry,
by asserting our authority over our own citizens
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>
in matters affecting the welfare of the
nation. An up-to-date mother, desiring that
her little boy should not play with the scissors,
would be ashamed to put them on a high
shelf: she would train the boy not to touch
them though they lay within his reach. Why
should the assemblage of mothers and fathers
who constitute the nation show less pride
about their methods than a lone woman in
the nursery?</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Outside the economic field, fear of the immigrant
is perhaps oftenest expressed in the
sociological anxiety concerning assimilation.
The question is raised whether so many different
races, products of a great variety of
physical and moral environments, can possibly
fuse into a harmonious nation, obedient
to one law, devoted to one flag. Some people
see no indication of the future in the fact that
race-blending has been going on here from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>
the beginning of our history, because the elements
we now get are said to differ from us
more radically than the elements we assimilated
in the past.</p>

<p>To allay our anxiety on this point, we have
only to remind ourselves that none of the
great nations of Europe that present such a
homogeneous front to-day arose from a single
stock; and the differences between peoples in
the times of the political beginnings of Europe
were vastly greater than the differences
between East and West, North and South,
to-day. Moreover, the European nations
were assorted at the point of the sword, while
in America the nations are coming together
of their own free will; and who can doubt
that the spiritual forces of common education,
common interests and associations are
more effective welding agents than brute
force?</p>

<p>Doubts as to the assimilative qualities of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>
current immigration do not exist in the minds
of the workers in settlements, libraries, and
schools. These people have a faith in the future
of the strangers that is based on long and
intimate experience with foreigners from
many lands. When they are dealing with the
normal product of immigration, the people
who come here following some dim star of
higher destiny for their children, the social
missionaries are jubilantly sure of the result;
and face to face with the less promising material
of the labor camps, where thousands are
brought together by the lure of the dollar and
are kept together by the devices of economic
exploitation, the missionaries are still undaunted.
They have discovered that sanitation
is a remedy for the filth of the camp;
that a spelling-book will make inroads on the
ignorance of the mob; that a lecture hall will
diminish the business of the saloon and the
brothel; that substituting neighborly kindness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
for brutal neglect will fan to a glow the
divine spark in the coarsest natures. And
then there is the Goethals way of managing
a labor camp.</p>

<p>The remedy for the moral indigestion
which unchecked immigration is said to
induce is in enlarging the organs of digestion.
More evening classes, more civic centers,
more missionaries in the field, and above all
more neighborly interest on the part of the
whole people. If immigration were a green
apple that we might take or leave, we might
choose between letting the apple alone or
eating it and following it up with a dose of
our favorite household remedy. But immigration
consists of masses of our fellow men
moving upon our country in pursuit of their
share of human happiness. Where human
rights are involved, we have no choice. We
have to eat this green apple,&mdash;the Law of the
Fathers enjoins it on us,&mdash;but we have only
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
ourselves to blame if we suffer from colic
afterwards, knowing the sure remedy.</p>

<p>There is no lack of resources, material or
spiritual, for carrying out our half of the
assimilation programme. We have money
enough, brains enough, inspiration enough.
The only reason the mill is grinding so slowly
is that the miller is overworked and the hopper
is choked. We are letting a few do the
work we should all be helping in. At the settlements,
devoted young men and women are
struggling with classes that are too large, or
turning away scores of eager children, and
their fathers and mothers, too, because there
are not enough helpers; and between classes
they spend their energies in running down
subscribers, getting up exhibitions to entice
the rich men of the community to come and
have a look at their mission and drop something
in the plate.</p>

<p>But why should there be a shortage of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>
helpers at the settlement? Have not the rich
men sons and daughters, as well as check-books?
What are those young people doing,
dancing the nights away in ballrooms and
roof-gardens, season after season, year after
year? They should be down on their knees
washing the feet of the pilgrims to the shrine
of liberty, binding up the wounds of the victims
of European despotism, teaching their
little foreign brothers and sisters the first
steps of civilized life.</p>

<p>Is it preposterous to ask that those who
have leisure and wealth should give of these
stores when they are needed in the chief enterprise
of the nation? In what does patriotism
consist if not in helping our country succeed
in her particular mission? Our mission&mdash;the
elevation of humanity&mdash;is one in
which every citizen should have a share, or
he is not an American citizen in the spiritual
sense. The poor must give of their little&mdash;the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
workingman must not seek to monopolize
the labor market; and the rich must give of
their plenty&mdash;their time, their culture, their
wealth.</p>

<p>Certain texts in the restrictionist teachings
are as insulting to our well-to-do citizens as
is the labor-monopoly preachment to the
classes who struggle for a living. The one
assumes that the American workingman puts
his family before his country; the other&mdash;the
cry that we cannot assimilate so many
strangers&mdash;implies that the country’s reservoirs
of wealth and learning and unspent
energy are monopolized by the well-to-do for
their own selfish uses. We know what schools
and lectures and neighborhood activities can
do to promote assimilation. We cannot fail if
we multiply these agencies as fast as the
social workers call for them. The means for
such extension of service are in the hands of
the rich. Whoever doubts our ability to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
assimilate immigration doubts the devotion
of our favored classes to the country’s cause.</p>

<p>Upon the rich and the poor alike rests the
burden of the fulfillment of the dream of the
Fathers, and they are poor patriots who seek
to lift that burden from our shoulders instead
of teaching us how to bear it nobly. Fresh
from the press, there lies on my table, as I
write, a review of an important work on immigration,
in which the reviewer refers to the
“sincere idealists who still cling to the superstition
that it is opposition to some predestined
divine purpose to suggest the rejection
of the ‘poor and oppressed.’” It is just such
teaching as that, which discards as so much
sentimental junk the ideas that made our
great men great, that is pushing us inch by
inch into the quagmire of materialism. If it
is true that our rich care for nothing but their
ease, and our poor have no thought beyond
their daily needs, it is due to the fact that the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
canker of selfishness is gnawing at the heart
of the nation. The love of self, absorption in
the immediate moment, are vices of the flesh
which fastened on us during the centuries of
our <ins title="agonzied">agonized</ins> struggle for brute survival. The
remedy that God appointed for these evils,
the vision of our insignificant selves as a part
of a great whole, whose lifetime is commensurate
with eternity, the materialists would
shatter and throw on the dump of human
illusions.</p>

<p>Who talks of superstition in a world built
on superstition? Civilization is the triumph
of one superstition after another. At the
very foundation of our world is the huge
superstition of the Fatherhood of God. In a
time when the peoples of the earth bowed
down to gods of stone, gods of wood, gods of
brass and of gold, what more incomprehensible
superstition could have been invented
than that of an invisible, omnipresent Creator
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
who made and ruled and disciplined the
entire universe? One nation ventured to
adopt this superstition, and that nation is
regarded as the liberator of humanity from
the slavery of bestial ignorance. Out of that
initial superstition followed, in logical sequence,
the superstition of the Brotherhood
of Man, spread abroad by a son of the venturesome
race; succeeded by a refinement of
the same notion, the idea that the Father has
no favorite children, but allots to each an
equal portion of the goods of His house.
That is democracy, the latest superstition of
them all, the cornerstone of our Republic,
and the model after which all the nations are
striving to pattern themselves.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Side by side in our public schools sit the
children of many races, ours and others.
Week by week, month by month, year by
year, the teachers pick out the brightest pupils
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
and fasten the medals of honor on their
breasts; and a startling discovery brings a
cry to their lips: the children of the foreigners
outclass our own! They who begin handicapped,
and labor against obstacles, leave
our own children far behind on the road
to scholarly achievement. In the business
world the same strange phenomenon is observed:
conditions of life and work that
would prostrate our own boys and girls, these
others use as a block from which to vault to
the back of prancing Fortune. In private
enterprises or public, in practical or visionary
movements, these outsiders exhibit an intensity
of purpose, a passion of devotion that do
not mark the normal progress of our own
well-cared-for children.</p>

<p>What is the galvanizing force that impels
these stranger children to overmaster circumstances
and bestride the top of the world?
Is there a special virtue in their blood that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>
enables them to sweep over our country and
take what they want? It is a special virtue,
yes: the virtue of great purpose. The fathers
and mothers of these children have not
weaned them from the habit of contemplating
a Vision. They teach them that, in pursuit
of the Vision, bleeding feet do not count.
They tell them that many morrows will roll
out of the lap of to-day, and they must prepare
themselves for a long and arduous
march.</p>

<p>That is the reading of the riddle, and if we
do not want to be shamed by the newcomers
in our midst, we must silence those sophisticated
teachers of the people who ridicule or
pass over with a smile the idea that we, as a
nation, are in pursuit of a Vision, and that
those things are good for us which further
our quest, and the rest&mdash;even to bleeding
feet&mdash;do not count with us. It is the obliteration
of the Vision that causes the emptiness
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
in the lives of our children which they
are driven to fill up with tinsel pleasures and
meaningless activities of all sorts. The best
blood in the world is in their veins,&mdash;the
blood of heroes and martyrs, of dreamers and
doers,&mdash;filtered through less than half a
dozen generations. If they do not arise and
do great deeds all around us, it is because
their noble blood is clogged in their veins
through the infiltrations of materialism in
the teachings of the day.</p>

<p>For such an inconsequential whim as that
men should be free to pray in any way they
choose, the Pilgrim Fathers betook themselves
to a wilderness peopled with savages,
preferring to die by the tomahawk rather
than submit to clerical authority. The free
admission of immigrants is not half so rash
an adventure, and the thing to be gained by
it is a more obvious good than that of freedom
of worship. Even a child can understand
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>
that it is better for human beings, be
they Russians or Italians or Greeks, to get
into a country where there is enough to eat
and enough to wear, where nobody is permitted
to abuse anybody else, and where
story-books are given away, than it is to live
in countries where starvation and cruel
treatment is the lot of multitudes.</p>

<p>No man worthy of the name will deny that
moral paralysis is a worse evil than congestion
of the labor market, and moral paralysis
creeps on us whenever we throw down the
burden of duty to recline in the lap of comfort.
We shall see no prodigies in the ranks
of our children as long as we are ruled by the
calculating commercial spirit which takes
nothing on faith, which spurns as impracticable
whatever is not easily negotiable, and
repudiates our debt to the past as something
too fantastic for serious consideration. Before
the present era of prosperity set in, a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>
scoffer who would brand as superstition the
ideas for which our forefathers died would
not have spoken with the expectation of
being applauded, as he does to-day. Worldly
things, like comfort, position, security, and
what is called success, have absorbed our attention
to such a degree that some of us have
forgotten that there is any good save the
good of the flesh. Possessions have crowded
out aspirations, the applause of the world has
become more necessary than the inner satisfactions,
and the whole horizon of life is filled
with the glaring bulk of an overwhelming
prosperity.</p>

<p>No wonder a prophet like Edward Everett
Hale was moved to pray before his assembled
congregation, “Deliver us, O Lord!
from our terrible prosperity.” He saw what
the worship of fleshly good did to our children:
how it stripped from them the wings of
higher ambition, and shackled their feet, that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>
should be marching on to the conquest of
spiritual worlds, with the weight of false successes.
“Deliver us, O Lord! from our terrible
prosperity,” that our children may have
burdens to lift, that they may learn to
clutch at things afar, and their sight grow
strong with gazing after visions. “Deliver
us, O Lord! from our terrible prosperity,”
that simplicity of life may strip from us all
sophistication, till we learn to honor the
dreamers in our midst, and our prophets have
a place in the councils of the nation.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Not the good of the flesh, but that of the
spirit is the good we seek. If it is good for the
soul of this nation that we should walk in the
difficult path our Fathers trod, harkening
only to the inner voice, never pausing to hear
the counsels of cold prudence, then assuredly
it is good for us to lift up the burdens of welcoming
and caring for our brothers from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
other lands, thus putting into fuller use the
instrument of democracy the Fathers invented,&mdash;our
Republic, founded to promote
liberty and justice among men.</p>

<p>Or if we despise the omens, refuse to take
up the difficult task where our predecessors
left off, what awaits us? If we persist in pampering
ourselves as favorite children, and bedeck
ourselves with prosperity’s coat of many
colors, how long will it be before the less
favored brethren, covetous of our superabundance,
will strip us and sell us into the
bondage of decadence? Immigration on a
large scale into every country as thinly populated
as ours must go on, will go on, as long as
there are other countries with denser populations
and scantier resources for sustaining
them. Right through history, the needy
peoples have gone in and taken possession of
the fat lands of their neighbors. Formerly
these invasions were effected by force; nowadays
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>
they are largely effected by treaties,
laws, international understandings. But always
the tide flows from the lands of want to
the lands of plenty. Nature is behind this
movement; man has no power to check it permanently.
We in America may, if we choose,
shut ourselves up in the midst of our plenty
and gorge till we are suffocated, but that will
only postpone the day of a fair division of our
country’s riches. We shall grow inert from
fullness, drunk with the wine of prosperity,
and presently some culminating folly, such as
every degenerate nation sooner or later commits,
will leave us at the mercy of the first
comers, and our spoils will be divided among
the watchers outside our gates.</p>

<p>These things will not happen in a day, nor
in a generation, nor in a century, but have we
no care for the days that will follow ours?
When we talk about providing for to-morrow,
let us, in the name of all the wisdom that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>
science has so laboriously amassed, think of
that distant to-morrow when the things we
now do will have passed into history, to
stand for the children of that time either as a
glorious example or a fearful warning. If we
settle the immigration question selfishly, we
shall surely pay the penalty for selfishness.
And the rod will smite not our own shoulders,
but the shoulders of countless innocents
of our begetting.</p>

<p>The law that the hungry shall feed where
there is plenty is not the only one which we
defy when we turn away the strangers now at
our gates. A narrow immigration policy is in
opposition also to a primary law of evolution,
the law of continuous development along a
given line until a climax is reached. Now the
evolution of society has been from small isolated
groups to larger intermingling ones.
In the beginning of political history, every
city was a world unto itself, and labored at its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
own salvation behind fortified walls that
shut out the rest of the world. Presently
cities were merged into states, states united
into confederacies, confederacies into empires.
Peoples at first unknown to each other
even by name came to pass in and out of each
other’s territories, merging their interests,
their cultures, their bloods.</p>

<p>This process of the removal of barriers, begun
through conquests, commerce, and travels,
is approaching completion in our own era,
through the influences of science and invention.
“The world is my country” is a word
in many a mouth to-day. East and West
hold hands; North and South salute each
other. There remain a few ancient prejudices
to overcome, a few stumps of ignorance
to uproot, before all the nations of the earth
shall forget their boundaries, and move about
the surface of the earth as congenial guests at
a public feast.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>This, indeed, will be the proof of the ancient
saying, “He hath made of one blood all
nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of
the earth.” It is coming, inevitably it is
coming. We in America are in a position to
hasten the climax of the drama of unification.
If, instead of hastening it, we seek to delay
it, we step aside from the path of the world’s
progress.</p>

<p>America is not God’s last stand. That
which is to be is conditioned by what has
been. Sometime, somewhere, the Plan that
the centuries have brooded over will come
perfect out of the shell of Time. I am not
afraid that humanity will stop short of its
inevitable climax, but I am so jealous for
the glory of my country that I long to have
America retain the leadership which she has
held so nobly for a while. I desire that the
mantle of the New England prophets should
rest on the shoulders of our own children.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>Of the many convincing arguments that
have been advanced in support of the proposition
that immigration is good for us, I shall
quote only one, in the words of Grace Abbott,
of Chicago, when she sums up a study of
eleven immigrant nationalities from southern
and eastern Europe. “It was the faith in
America and not the occasional criticism that
touched me most,” she writes, referring to
the sayings of the foreigners. “I felt then, as
I have felt many times when I have met some
newcomer who has expected a literal fulfillment
of our democratic ideals, that fortunately
for America we had great numbers
who were coming to remind us of the
‘promise of American life,’ and insisting that
it should not be forgotten.”</p>

<p>All the rest of the arguments&mdash;utilitarian,
humanitarian, and scientific&mdash;I willingly
omit. For I do not want the immigrant to be
admitted because he can help us dig ditches
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>
and build cities and fight our battles in general.
I beg that we make this a question
of principle first, and of utility afterwards.
Whether immigration is good for us or not, I
am very certain that the decadence of idealism
is bad for us, and that is what I fear
more than the restrictionist fears the immigrant.</p>

<p>It should strengthen us in our resolution to
abide by the Law of the Fathers&mdash;the law of
each for all, and all for each&mdash;if we find that
the movement of democracy to which they
imparted such a powerful impulse appears to
be in the direct path of social evolution. But
even if such omens were lacking I should still
pray for strength to cling to the ideal which is
defined in the opening words of the Declaration
of Independence. For I perceive that
here, in the trial at Ellis Island, we are put to
the test of the fiery furnace. It was easy to
preach democracy when the privileges we
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
claimed for ourselves no alien hordes sought
to divide with us. But to-day, when humanity
asks us to render up again that which we
took from the English in the name of humanity,
do we dare to stand by our confession of
faith? Those who honor the golden images
of self-interest and materialism threaten us
with fearful penalties in case we persist in
our championship of universal brotherhood.
They are binding our hands and feet with
the bonds of selfish human fears. The fiery
glow of the furnace is on our faces&mdash;and the
world holds its breath.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>Once the thunders of God were heard on
Mount Sinai, and a certain people heard, and
the blackness of idolatry was lifted from the
world. Again the voice of God, the Father,
shook the air above Bunker Hill, and the
grip of despotism was loosened from the
throat of panting humanity.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>Let the children of the later saviors of the
world be as faithful as the children of the
earlier saviors, and perhaps God will speak
again in times to come.</p>
